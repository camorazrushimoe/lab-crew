# Skill: handoff

## Purpose

Package research findings into a form that DevCrew (or another product team) can act on without needing the original researchers.

## When to use

- Research Report concludes that something is worth building
- Manager asks for a product-ready package

## Minimum handoff package

Create (or update) `workspace/<topic>/handoff/` with:

1. **SUMMARY.md** — short decision + why
2. **validated-hypotheses.md** — what was supported / rejected
3. **data-sources.md** — recommended sources, collection notes, limitations
4. **evaluation.md** — metrics and evaluation approach that should carry into the product
5. **requirements-sketch.md** — draft requirements or OpenSpec-style notes (optional but valuable)
6. **open-questions.md** — risks and unknowns

## Discipline

- Write for a reader who was not in the research loop
- Do not assume shared context
- Prefer concrete recommendations over vague “further research needed” when a decision is possible
- Explicitly state what LabCrew is *not* handing off (no production code, no long-lived infra)
