# Skill: data-collection

## Purpose

Collect and organize temporary datasets needed for experiments — without building production infrastructure.

## When to use

- An experiment design requires data that is not yet local
- Multiple sources must be combined for a single test

## Principles

1. Collect only what the current hypothesis needs
2. Store under `workspace/<topic>/data/`
3. Prefer flat, inspectable formats (CSV, JSONL, parquet) over opaque stores
4. Record provenance: source, date collected, sampling method, known gaps
5. Keep a short `data/README.md` describing what is in the folder

## Minimum documentation for a dataset

```markdown
# Dataset: <name>
- Source: ...
- Collected: YYYY-MM-DD
- Sample size: ...
- Fields: ...
- Known limitations: ...
```

## Anti-patterns

- Silent collection with no provenance notes
- Dumping everything into one undocumented folder
- Treating temporary research data as a long-lived product asset
